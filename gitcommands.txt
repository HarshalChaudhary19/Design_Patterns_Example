---Basic Commands---

git init
git add file.txt
git add . 
git commit -m "msg"
git remote add origin repolink
git branch -M main
git checkout -b features
git push -u origin features (or main or wherever we want to add the code)

---Merge and Rebase---
git merge branchname
git diff (for seeing the conflicts)
    then from vscode check the differences and resolve the conflicts
    there are three options......Jo hai wohi rakhna hai.....Jo nya hai wo.......Ya fir combination

for Rebase



---Git Cherypick command---
    Basically we use this when we want to merge some particular commits to some branch then we cherry pick them

    git log branchname (To see all the commits with id's)
    git cherry-pick 7f4c12d someid someid2 

    And then do the next steps

---Git Stash commands---
    Basically we can store our uncommited changes to a stash (added or without putting to add stage)
    git stash -----to put the uncommited changes to stash 
    git stash -u       Will add the untracked files too
    git stash staged      To add only the staged files and not the unstaged files 
    git stash list        To get back the list of stashes
    git stash apply stash@{stash_number}    To get data back from stash
    ===Can also drop but command dekhni pdegi uski===
    git stash pop       Works as both apply and drop =...just like in a stack

--=Git Revert Commands=--  (Whereas Git reset actually removes commits and history)
    =>Basically what it does is that it does not delete the last commits instead what it does is it creates a new commit that
      goes undergoes the changes introduced till the given commit (Reversing)
    
    Commands
    -->git revert <commit-hash>  (Normaly reverting the commit and creating a new one)
    -->git revert Head~3..Head  (or git revert Head) (This reverts last 3 commits) Or (the second command reverts the last one only)
    -->git revert -n <commit-hash> (this applies the revert changes to the working directory without commiting yet so we can make changes and commit)
    -->git revert A..B (Reverts range from here to here)
    -->git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash> (This is used for merge commits here we are gonna use the parent#1 for the base reference)
    -->git revert -q <hash> (Revert and auto-commit messages)
    -->git revert --abort (Abort a revert....if conflict happens)
    -->git revert --continue (Continue after resolving merge request)


==Case Scenerios== 
--> Lets suppose I have added 4 files to the staging area and we only need to commit 3 of those files then what
